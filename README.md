## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Set up PostgreSQL** (locally or on a cloud instance)
2. Run `create.sql` to create all tables
3. Place `.csv` files into an accessible path (e.g. `/tmp/` on Mac/Linux)
4. Edit paths in `load.sql` and run it to populate the tables
5. Execute queries from `solutions.sql` in PgAdmin or terminal
6. Use `explain_queries.sql` to analyze query performance
7. View saved screenshots in `/screenshots/`

## 📊 Bonus (Optional Web App)

You can optionally implement a **Streamlit dashboard** under `/webapp/` to:
- Show top-selling products
- Visualize category revenue
- Track monthly sales trends

This will earn bonus points if deployed and included in your final submission.
